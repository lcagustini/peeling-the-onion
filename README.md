# peeling-the-onion

A little game which goal is to discover which news is the real one, since both titles are absurd.

There are 2 versions to play: International news in English and brazilian news in portuguese.

International mode is based on the popular site [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/) and the real news are from [Not The Onion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/) subreddit. Brazilian news are from [Sensacionalista](http://sensacionalista.com.br/) and its real news version is [Surrealista](http://surrealista.com.br/).

There's a second repo with the code used to get all the news for the BR version. You can check it at
https://github.com/danipj/sensacionalista-crawler. Logic used for EN version is at ```game.html```.
